<h1>About ReproServer</h1>

<p>As research has become increasingly reliant on digital tools, the challenges in reproducibility have become more poignant. Releasing code and data are key to open research, but not necessarily enough for reproducibility. There are dependencies that aren't easily capture, and effect the reproducibility of research. In response to these challenges, we created ReproZip, an open source tool (see <a href="https://github.com/ViDA-NYU/reprozip">GitHub repo</a>) that bundles everything necessary to reproduce your work -- down to the operating system level!</p>

<p>ReproZip allows you to pack your research along with all necessary data files, libraries, and environment variables and options. Then anybody can reproduce the research on a different machine, without tracking down and installing the dependencies. While these packages (<code>.rpz</code> files) are small and easy to share, it does require that the person unpacking the ReproZip file to install extra software -- ReproUnzip, and one of our unpackers (e.g. Vagrant or Docker). You can read more about standalone ReproZip and ReproUnzip via the <a href="https://reprozip.readthedocs.io/en/1.0.x/">documentation</a>.

<p><strong>In an effort to lower the barrier to sharing reproducible work, we've developed the ReproServer</strong>. This application, still a work in progress, enables you to reproduce ReproZip packages from your web browser, without having to install ReproUnzip on your computer!</p>

<!--------------------------------------REPRODUCING--------------------------------------------->
<h2>Getting Started</h2>

<p>Upload your own <code>.rpz</code> file, or try uploading one of the examples from the <a href="https://examples.reprozip.org/">ReproZip-Examples repository</a>, and click the "Unpack" button!</p>

<p>From there, you can view the build log and (optionally) upload your own inputs. To reproduce the work "as is", simply click the "Run" button and watch as the research is rerun before your eyes, complete with an additional build log and the outputs from the research, which you can then download.</p>

<p>In the future, you will be able to simply provide a link to a <code>.rpz</code> file and unpack and rerun it. Keep your eyes out!</p>

<h2>The Team</h2>

<p>The ReproServer project is run by the <a href="https://www.reprozip.org/">ReproZip</a> team from New York University.</p>
